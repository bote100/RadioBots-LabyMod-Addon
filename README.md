# RadioBots LabyMod Addon

I created with my [RadioBots Java API](https://github.com/bote100/RadioBots-Java-API) a [LabyMod](http://labymod.net) Addon.
You are able to manage your bot with simple chat commands and display informations about the current selected bot on your
ingame screen (Module).

### !! Compiling !!
To compile the sourcecode you have to add all needed dependencies and run the command ```gradlew fatJar```. After that you
must enter the jar as example with WinRAR and remove the ``assets`` and ``net.labymod`` folder.


### Features

* 3 diffrent modules (Display: volume, current server and song)
* Chat-Command (Manage bot) as important design goal
